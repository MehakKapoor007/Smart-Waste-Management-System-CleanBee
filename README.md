# Smart-Waste-Management-System-CleanBee

CleanBee is a personal research project in the field of IoT. Created by team Cyberics, this was a research project done in semester 2, and we have taken it forward by creating and implementing the hardware prototype to come up with a ready to use product. The hardware prototype consists of IoT sensors like Ultrasonic sensor, IR sensor. 

This project focuses on managing waste in a more effective way through an application. The application has two interfaces, for general public and for muncipal authorities and resedential socity management. 
It will help the workers and auhtorities to manage the wastebins in the area and what is the shortest way through them, it'll give an notification if any of the wastebin is overflowing or needs maintainance. The app will showcase the wste percentage levels of all the wastebins so that it'll be easier for cleaning authorities in cleaning. The general public can use the app to find the neaest dustbin in their area. they can also page complaints and feedbacks for the authorities.
